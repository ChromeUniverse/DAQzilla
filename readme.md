# DAQzilla ü¶ñ

A monster all-in-one modular IP core for FPGA-based Data Acquisition (DAQ), built in SystemVerilog. Designed with automotive-grade applications in mind: think racecar telemetry, low-latency data logging, real-time sensor streaming, etc.

**DAQzilla** absolutely devours data and eats complexity for breakfast, bringing everything under one roof:

- A custom **SPI master** for high-precision ADC interfacing
- A pluggable **DSP pipeline** for real-time filtering and signal conditioning
- A lightweight, fully custom **CAN 2.0A controller** for transmitting calibrated sensor readings

Originally inspired by the Izze Racing [SGAMP-V2](https://www.izzeracing.com/products/ewExternalFiles/Izze_Racing_SGAMP_V2_Datasheet.pdf) strain gauge amplifier and my experience as Data Acquisition lead for [Carnegie Mellon Racing](https://www.carnegiemellonracing.org/team) in Formula SAE. The name was inspired by the ["Godzilla" Nissan GT-R ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmvwj_BqDNI) and the ["Rexy" Porsche 911 GT3-R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUI5EOyBW04&pp=ygUMcmV4eSBwb3JzY2hl).
